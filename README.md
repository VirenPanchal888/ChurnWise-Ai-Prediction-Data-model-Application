This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. 
It involves loading data from an Excel file, followed by data cleaning, where missing values are handled by filling numerical columns with their median values. 
Visualization techniques, including charts and maps, are used to explore trends and customer behavior patterns related to churn. 
Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree are trained to predict customer churn. 
The models are evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. 
Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are employed for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. 
Future improvements may include feature engineering, advanced machine learning models, and interactive dashboards.
